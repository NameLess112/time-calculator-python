# Time Calculator

This project has three Python files. This is a work in progress!

## twotimes.py

To run this in CMD, simply navigate to the director where your file is saved and type in "py twotimes.py".
In this file, the user inputs a start and end time. The output is the amount of time that has elapsed in hours and minutes.

## onetime.py

To run this in CMD, simply navigate to the director where your file is saved and type in "py onetime.py".
In this file, the user inputs a start/end time and the amount of time that has elapsed. The output will be the end/start time.

## test.py

This is just my test file where I ran snippets of code in order to debug.

# Goals
- Create a interactive web-based applications using JavaScript
- Simplify the code
- Less bugs!

# Issues and Bugs

I am always finding bugs and trying to fix them! If you run the code and find issues, feel free to let me know or add a contribution/issue request. I am always open to make my code more efficient and less buggy :)
